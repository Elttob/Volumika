				<h2>Roblox's premier volumetric fog solution</h2>
				<p>
					It's time for jaw-dropping, belief-suspending graphics. VOLUMIKA
					is Roblox's first-ever high performance, fully dynamic, truly
					global volumetric fog solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not just for the powerful PCs; VOLUMIKA runs excellently
					with a wide range of graphics cards. It even achieves great
					performance on high-end phones and other mobile devices.

				<h2>A generational leap in graphics</h2>
				<p>
					VOLUMIKA is built upon innovative new ways to manipulate the
					Roblox engine's rendering pipeline for maximum visual quality.
					Featuring proper additive blending, smoothed intersections with
					geometry, light sampling directly from Roblox's voxel grid, and
					temporally stable results, no other previous technique comes
					close to achieving a complete package this good looking.
				</p>
				<p>
					VOLUMIKA also gives you greater artistic control compared to any
					other technique. Fine tune almost any visual aspect, from fog
					tinting to lighting influence to dithering characteristics.
					What's more, it's consistent across every available lighting
					engine on Roblox - most notably Future. VOLUMIKA puts the
					final appearance of your scene back in your hands.
				</p>

				<h2>Breakthrough performance</h2>
				<p>
					Compared to previous volumetric lighting approximations and
					techniques, VOLUMIKA not only delivers more accurate whole-room
					dynamic lighting with softer edges and deeper volume, but it
					does so while achieving category-leading framerates. It's so
					much more performant that, for the very first time, you can ship
					volumetric lighting as a viable option for your players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Benchmarked on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 GPU and an Intel Core
					i5-8600K CPU, VOLUMIKA is capable of outputting a solid 150
					frames per second at 1440p, and capable of outputting 120 frames
					per second to a Valve Index VR headset.

				<h2>Indie-made, industry-changing</h2>
				<p>
					VOLUMIKA was researched and developed independently by Elttob as
					part of a years-long project to bring fully-fledged, rigorously built
					volumetric lighting techniques to Roblox. Representing thousands
					of hours of research combined with specialised and deep
					knowledge of Roblox's engine features and render pipeline,
					VOLUMIKA sets the standard for all volumetric fog
					implementations and unlocks entirely new capabilities for
					creators.

				<h2>Buy once, yours to use</h2>
				<p>
					Subscriptions and restrictive licenses have the potential to
					harm creators when misused. That's why VOLUMIKA doesn't use
					them. With VOLUMIKA, you can use your version forever, and you
					only pay for new features and versions when you want them. It's
					a fairer model that simultaneously gives you freedom and helps
					ensure fair compensation - everyone wins.
